(the one i used in my screenshot)
#### why are you doing this?
just for fun, there is nothing else behind this
#### resource usage and speed
Im committing slowly and in low quantity to prevent server over-usage of GitHub.
So no one is harmed and everyone is happy.
#### script
My script is not available for download for the simple reason than people could just abuse it and basically break everything, it could piss GH staff and they could ban my repository or even my whole profile, i don't want this to happen because im trying everything to keep my project harmless for them.
#### A note for Github
I'm aware than committing a lot in high quantity can impact your servers, so i am doing to necessary to prevent this:
0 byte commits
empty project
push every 5 - 10 seconds
and committing in low quantities
**Github, if you want me to stop this just send me a mail, you don't have to be aggressive.**
